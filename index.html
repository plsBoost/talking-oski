    <h1>Most kids start their reading journey with Judy B. Jones or Harry Potter, but as a child of immigrants I started with W-2s and 1091s. I have been my parents' official translator since I was five, interpreting English legal documents into Urdu. My services expanded beyond my immediate family to encompass the broader South Asian Muslim community, revealing a pervasive lack of legal literacy. Witnessing the ways my family and community struggles with sense of belonging, discriminatory labor practices, inequitable education access and language barriers inspired me to investigate exploitative systems and power imbalances. Therefore, my intended major is Political Science and Economics.

        In preparation to double major, I've maximized my college's diverse class opportunities by consistently applying for unit overload and taking extra courses during breaks to challenge myself. This effort has built a strong foundation in political science, economics, business, and communications, completing three times the standard credits by the time I transfer while maintaining my grades. Even if I am unable to double major, I believe I am ready to succeed in upper-division courses, and the experience from preparing for each major will provide me with the background necessary for an interdisciplinary education
        
        Beyond academics, I channeled my passion for justice into real-world impact through my role as the Director of Finance for the Associated Student Organization. Representing 20,000 students, I met with college administration to discuss financial allocations for student projects, such as providing affordable meals, clean drinking water, and a multi-faith center. The pinnacle of my advocacy journey occurred at the National Student Advocacy conference in Washington, D.C. I co-drafted a bill addressing financial aid barriers and outdated Satisfactory Academic Progress policies. This experience strengthened my commitment to bridge the gap between policy advocacy and grassroots initiatives.
        
        From assisting with taxes since childhood to my role in student advocacy, my commitment to justice has been a constant thread in my life. My goal is to promote global justice and equity, addressing legal challenges, especially within Muslim-majority regions. This preparation positions me to thrive in UC schools, contributing meaningfully to the world of policy.
